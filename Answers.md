1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

        Server-side routing will cause each page to refresh as data is being grabbed from a server. SEO must use server-side routing.

        Client-side routing handles data locally, and does not cause a page refresh. Generally faster and smoother since data is not trying to be reached from server.
